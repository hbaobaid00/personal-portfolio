                <h3>My Background</h3>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born and raised in <em>San Diego, California</em>. I am a fourth year Computer Science student, pursuing my Bachelor of Science degree at <a href="https://ucsd.edu/">University of California, San Diego</a>. 
                        Over the last couple of years, I have developed a strong foundation in programming, algorithms, and system design. I have worked on various projects that have honed my skills and expanded my knowledge in the tech industry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growing up, I was always interested in technology and building new things. This curiosity led me to exploring computers and how they worked. 
                        The first time I was introduced to programming was in middle school, where I was a part of a VEX Robotics team. This was my first ever big project where I built and programmed a robot that was responsible for completeting various tasks in a competitive environment.
                        We programmed the motor's and sensors of the robot using VEXcode, which is based on Python. I found it particularly fascinating how lines of code could control a physical machine.
                        From that point on, I was hooked and decided to pursue a career in technology.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of VEX Robotics, I decided to further my knowledge in programming by taking computer science courses in high school and college. 
                        Fortunately, my high school offered a 3-year computer science pathway that taught me the fundamentals of programming and data structures. During my time in high school, I worked on several projects, including building simple games and web applications.
                        These experiences solidified my passion for coding and motivated me to continue learning and growing in this field.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as a college student, I am constantly seeking new opportunities to expand my skill set and work on exciting projects. I even enjoy helping other students with their CSE classes as I have tutored for the <a href="https://cse.ucsd.edu/">CSE Department at UCSD</a> before. 
                        I have helped over 500 students with their programming assignments and exam preparation, ensuring they understand the material and can apply it effectively. Helping others has a;ways been a passion of mine, and I find it incredibly rewarding to see others succeed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am particularly interested in <span class="highlight">web development</span> and <span class="highlight">AI agents.</span> Just recently, I finished my inernship with a startup company called SkillWorld. Our goal was to make AI Agents more efficient. I was responsible for installing and running several open-source models, and extract the log files to see what kinds of actions these agents would take.
                        It was a wonderful experience, and I got to work with amazing people as well. Looking forward, I am eager to explore these areas further through more internships and personal projects. 
                        I believe that technology has the power to transform lives, and I am excited to be a part of this ever-evolving industry.
